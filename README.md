Warning - This document is a Work In Progress

Run the script
Enter the key followed by Enter
e.g. C<Enter> for C

When prompted for notation enter a space separate list of chord notations followed by <Enter>
e.g. ii<Enter> for the Minor Second
e.g. II<Enter> for the Major Second
e.g. bIII<Enter> for the Flattened Major Third
e.g. VI7<Enter> for the Major Sixth Dominant Seventh
e.g. VIM7<Enter> for the Major Sixth Seventh
e.g. vi7<Enter> for the Minor Sixth Seventh

Also: 
IIsus2 or iisus2 for sus2 (not major or minor, express either way)
IIsus4 or iisus4 for sus4 (not major or minor, express either way)

II+ for Augmented
II+7 for Augmented Seventh


You can also mix in common progressions from a canned list I have included, by using the numbers 1 to 15.
E.g. when prompted for notation, enter something like:

0 bIII 7 vi7 12<Enter>

This will play canned progression 0, followed by flattened third, then canned progression 7, followed by minor sixth seventh, followed by canned progression 12.
