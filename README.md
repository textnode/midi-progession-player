Warning - This document is a Work In Progress

Run the script and when prompted key in the tonic followed by &lt;Enter&gt;

When prompted for notation enter a space separate list of chord notations followed by <Enter>
* e.g. ii&lt;Enter&gt; for the Minor Second
* e.g. II&lt;Enter&gt; for the Major Second
* e.g. bIII&lt;Enter&gt; for the Flattened Major Third
* e.g. VI7&lt;Enter&gt; for the Major Sixth Dominant Seventh
* e.g. VIM7&lt;Enter&gt; for the Major Sixth Seventh
* e.g. vi7&lt;Enter&gt; for the Minor Sixth Seventh

Also: 
* e.g. IIsus2 or iisus2 for sus2 (not major or minor, express either way)
* e.g. IIsus4 or iisus4 for sus4 (not major or minor, express either way)

* e.g. II+ for Augmented
* e.g. II+7 for Augmented Seventh


You can also mix in common progressions from a canned list I have included, by using the numbers 1 to 15.
E.g. when prompted for notation, enter something like:

* 0 bIII 7 vi7 12&lt;Enter&gt;

This will play canned progression 0, followed by flattened third, then canned progression 7, followed by minor sixth seventh, followed by canned progression 12.
